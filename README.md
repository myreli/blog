```shell
# install gems
bundle install

# start the server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Copyright and License

There are two main parts composing this blog: writing (which are my blog posts - referred as Content) and code (which is the Jekyll theme and its modifications referred as Code) so we have different types of license and copyright. 

Basically: please respect my mind's effort but feel free to create a blog of your own being original. =D
